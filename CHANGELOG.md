# Changelog

All notable changes to LoFiBox Zero will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Added an explicit `lofibox-widget` Wayland layer-shell runtime for TDVP/Labwc sessions. It uses a 320 x 170 top-layer surface, does not reserve desktop work area, and receives mouse-emulated touch input without opening the framebuffer directly.
- Added pointer and touch dragging for the TDVP widget. A dragged placement is persisted as its right and bottom layer-shell margins in XDG configuration, while short gestures remain normal UI taps.

### Changed
- The widget runtime uses ARGB shared-memory buffers and avoids a Wayland surface commit when the rendered UI pixels did not change.
- TDVP/Labwc widget dragging now uses consecutive raw pointer coordinates. This avoids feeding layer-surface repositioning back into the gesture delta, which previously caused rapid runaway drift.
- TDVP widget drag motion now accumulates small pointer deltas and applies them only after a 5-pixel deadband, prioritizing stable touch motion without changing the click threshold.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- Added a persistent local-library index so refreshes and application restarts reuse metadata for unchanged audio files, while files whose path, size, or modification time changed are read again.
- Reused Linux FreeType font resources, PCM work buffers, spectrum plans, and DSP coefficient storage on the realtime playback path.
- Switched Linux short-lived helper processes, including local metadata probes, to `posix_spawn`.

### Fixed
- Avoided holding the UI visualization mutex while calculating real PCM-derived spectrum bands.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-05-27

### Changed
- Updated Debian package maintainer metadata to use the verified package owner identity required by the community package validation workflow.
- Stopped building and publishing `armhf` preview APT packages; the preview repository now targets `amd64` and `arm64`.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Added a native Wayland desktop-widget target (`lofibox_zero_wayland`) for compositor-managed Cardputer Zero sessions while retaining the framebuffer device target for legacy APPLaunch launches.

### Changed
- Cardputer Zero APPLaunch metadata now declares the native Wayland display contract and the installed wrapper chooses Wayland, X11, or framebuffer at runtime from the session environment.
- Cardputer Zero APPLaunch launches now enable the LoFiBox WebUI by default so Settings can show the device WebUI address in both Wayland and framebuffer sessions.

### Fixed
- Settings now shows the started WebUI address even if the host connectivity probe is offline, avoiding a false "WebUI missing" state when the local service is already running.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- Linux CI now explicitly verifies that the default Linux test configuration includes `lofibox_webui_smoke`.

### Fixed
- Fixed Linux PCM child-process exit handling so decoder or sink exit while pipe reads are pending is observed promptly, and a backend finish whose reported position remains far before the known duration now pauses the current track instead of being interpreted as normal queue completion.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- Linux builds now compile the WebUI target by default, so default Linux CI configurations build `lofibox_webui` and run its smoke coverage without an opt-in CMake flag.
- Settings now shows the WebUI address when the WebUI is enabled and network status is online; long addresses remain in the normal right-side value column and scroll inside that bounded area.

### Fixed
- Fixed premature auto-advance when an audio backend reports `Finished` before the playback clock has reached the known track duration by requiring the projected position to be within 1.5 seconds of the end before queue completion can run.
- Restored realtime throttling for local Linux PCM decoding so ffmpeg does not decode an entire local file far ahead of the PipeWire/ALSA sink.
- Reduced local Linux track-switch latency by moving old realtime PCM pipeline shutdown off the critical path, removing blocking local output-confirmation retry from startup, and starting audio before synchronous local metadata/artwork refresh.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- GUI/device playback mode shortcuts now use one cycle: order -> shuffle -> repeat all -> repeat one -> order. Main Menu `F6` and Now Playing Up/Down trigger the same playback-mode command, while `F7`/`F8` are no longer primary GUI/device playback-mode shortcuts.

### Fixed
- Fixed Linux evdev keyboard direction handling so only standard `KEY_UP`, `KEY_DOWN`, `KEY_LEFT`, and `KEY_RIGHT` events become direction commands; ordinary letter keys such as `KEY_X`, `KEY_F`, `KEY_S`, `KEY_Z`, and `KEY_C` remain character input.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- Direct local-root mutation commands now best-effort request a running instance library refresh, so GUI/TUI sessions can reload enabled roots after add/remove/enable/disable without waiting for a restart.

### Fixed
- Fixed Linux runtime path and default-root resolution for APPLaunch/device launches with sparse environments: when `HOME` is unset, LoFiBox resolves the effective user's account home before falling back, so root-owned device starts read `/root/.local/share/lofibox` and default to `/root/Music`.
- Added GUI startup coverage for persisted local-root profiles so restart-time configured-root scans populate the visible library.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Added durable local media roots as `SourceProfilesDomain` local-root profiles with stable ids, labels, enabled/default-eligible flags, and no credential reference.
- Added `lofibox source local-root list/add/remove/enable/disable` and library-facing `lofibox library root list/add/remove/enable/disable` aliases.
- Added runtime `library-refresh` support so a running instance can reload durable enabled local roots and refresh its in-memory library index.

### Changed
- GUI and device startup now refresh the library from enabled local roots through application services instead of target-local or scanner-owned product defaults.
- The default local media root is now `~/Music` when no enabled local-root profile exists; `/music` remains only an explicit or compatibility fallback.
- `lofibox library scan [path...]` and `--root` paths remain temporary diagnostic roots and do not become durable library roots.

### Fixed
- Fixed startup root resolution for root-owned deployments: when the process home is `/root`, the unconfigured default local library root resolves to `/root/Music`.
- Filtered local-root profiles out of remote browse/search flows while preserving their profile persistence.
- Fixed Windows/MSVC release builds by compiling sources as UTF-8 and using the correct wide-character `curl.exe` helper lookup.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- Fixed Cardputer Zero APPLaunch startup by launching LoFiBox through an installed wrapper that resolves the ST7789V framebuffer from `LOFIBOX_FBDEV`, inherited APPLaunch environment, `/proc/fb`, or `/dev/fb1` fallback.
- Fixed Cardputer Zero keyboard device selection by allowing the APPLaunch wrapper to inherit `APPLAUNCH_LINUX_KEYBOARD_DEVICE` before falling back to the known Cardputer evdev path.
- Fixed APPLaunch packaging so `lofibox_zero_device` is always installed at `/usr/lib/lofibox/lofibox_zero_device` when the device target is built.
- Fixed APPLaunch icon sizing by installing a LoFiBox-owned Cardputer-sized icon instead of symlinking the standard `180x180` hicolor desktop icon.
- Added a Cardputer APPLaunch metadata smoke test and specification coverage for the wrapper, install layout, framebuffer precedence, keyboard-device precedence, and icon boundary.

- **`AudioEffectCycle` runtime command** — cycles OFF → Radio → Tape → Vinyl → OFF through the full runtime command bus, serialized in `runtime_envelope_serializer.cpp`, tracked in `RuntimeSnapshot`/`RuntimeEvent`.
- **Effect state** — `EqRuntimeState` gains `effect_plugin_id`, `effect_id`, `effect_intensity`. `EqRuntimeSnapshot` gains `effect_name`, `effect_enabled`.
- **UI surfaces for remix**: GUI (`R` key + Equalizer/Now Playing display), TUI (`R` key, `r` stays reconnect), WebUI (REMIX badge + Settings CYCLE button + `R`/`r` key), CLI (`lofibox remix`).
- **Remix specification** (`docs/specification/lofibox-zero-audio-dsp-spec.md` Section 11) — full spec covering registry model, three effect parameters, shared infrastructure, switching behavior, UI contract, data model, and AI constraints.
- **WebUI remote-control surface** — HTTP/WebSocket server providing browser-based remote control.
  - Single-file SPA frontend (`assets/webui/index.html`) with embedded CSS and JavaScript — no build step, no external dependencies.

- **Smoke test suite** (`tests/webui_smoke.cpp`) — 8 test groups covering config parsing, JSON helpers, snapshot/event projection, command parsing (10 action mappings), static asset serving, runtime adapter integration, and HTTP router responses. Uses a `FakeRuntimeCommandClient` for zero-dependency testing.
- **Design specification** (`docs/webui-design-spec.md`) — 13-section comprehensive spec covering positioning, dependency boundary, pages, API design, frontend architecture, WebSocket protocol details, command mapping, source layout, deployment, CMake integration, tests, and CI architecture enforcement rules.

### Changed
- **DSP limiter disabled by default** — `EqProfile::limiter_enabled` and `LimiterProfile::enabled` now default to `false`. Previous default of `enabled=true` with `ceiling_db=-1.0` caused hard clipping at 0.891 linear for all playback.
- **Hard-clamp limiter removed** — only final ±1.0 safety clamp remains. `ClipStats` diagnostics added (`over_ceiling_count`, `over_fullscale_count`, `peak_before`, `peak_after`) with ~5s periodic logging.
- **Library scanning made asynchronous** — background scan thread with progress callbacks; boot page now shows per-phase progress (SCANNING FILES / READING METADATA / BUILDING INDEXES) with file counts, current path, and a progress bar.
- **`-re` flag removed for local playback** — ffmpeg decoder no longer constrains decode speed for local files. Retained for network streams only. Improves buffer fill and reduces underrun risk.
- **GUI artwork fixed for remote tracks** — `PlaybackController::refreshArtwork()` now routes remote tracks through `readRemoteIdentity()` with enrichment cache keys and artwork URL fallback, matching WebUI behavior.
- **9 smoke tests updated** for async scanning model (loop-until-ready). `app_lifecycle_smoke.cpp` rewritten with 4 test scenarios including multi-tick Loading polling.
- `LoFiBoxApp` constructor accepts optional `WebUiConfig` parameter (gated by `LOFIBOX_HAVE_WEBUI`).
- `runLoFiBoxApp()` signature extended with optional `WebUiConfig` parameter.
- X11 and Device target mains parse `--webui*` CLI flags and pass config to the app runner.
- **Version management overhaul** — single source of truth enforced across the entire project:
  - `LOFIBOX_VERSION` compile definition moved from `lofibox_zero_target_cli` only to `lofibox_zero_core` (PUBLIC), ensuring all libraries and executables inherit the version macro.
  - `app_projection_builder.cpp`: replaced hardcoded `"0.1.0"` with `LOFIBOX_VERSION` preprocessor macro (fallback `"unknown"`), aligning GUI About page with CMake version.
  - `jellyfin_provider.py`: replaced hardcoded `"0.1.0"` User-Agent with import from CMake-generated `version.py` module (fallback `"0.0.0-dev"` for development builds).
  - `cmake/version.py.in` template added — `configure_file()` injects `PROJECT_VERSION` at build time; installed to `${LOFIBOX_PRIVATE_LIBDIR}` for Python helpers.
  - `debian/changelog` bumped to `0.2.0-1`.
  - `data/io.github.vicliu624.lofibox.metainfo.xml` added `0.2.0` release entry for AppStream metadata.
- `docs/webui-design-spec.md` added Section 14: comprehensive version control design documentation covering single source of truth, CMake→C++ and CMake→Python propagation, all consumer mappings, app version vs snapshot version distinction, version bump procedure, and Debian compliance requirements.
- `docs/specification/lofibox-zero-version-control-spec.md` created — standalone version control specification covering all 10 sections (purpose, single source of truth, CMake→C++ propagation, CMake→Python propagation, consumer registry, app vs snapshot version distinction, bump procedure, Debian compliance, forbidden patterns, AI constraints). Cross-referenced from `project-architecture-spec.md` and `debian-official-archive-spec.md`.
